# Docs

Quick notes on approach + decisions. Git tracks changes so I can reference later & Clever team can review.

## Skills to showcase

Based on the [job description](https://clever-real-estate.breezy.hr/p/1a27837eff8e-frontend-software-engineer), here are the main stack/things to showcase:

- React + TypeScript (core requirement)
- NextJS/Gatsby + React Native experience
- TDD/BDD approach with proper testing
- Design patterns (when/when not to use)
- Git workflow + collaboration
- Problem breakdown + tradeoffs discussion
- TailwindCSS styling
- AWS/Vercel deployment
- Clear documentation + communication

## Drafting TODOs

Drafting some things... The goal it to have the figma mockup working, but... if time allows...

- [] monorepo setup to share utils/components/styles/linting/code-quality between web (gatsby), mobile (RN), and core app components.
- [] husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
- [] TypeScript strict mode for type safety and catching issues early
- [x] TailwindCSS for consistent styling (already scaffolded by create-next-app)
- [ ] unit tests with jest + react-testing-library
- [ ] e2e with selenium
- [ ] ci/cd, something simple for now, like making sure tests pass before deploying to vercel
- [ ] storybook for component library
- [ ] a11y rules + testing
- [ ] state management with zustand (probably overkill, but zustand is the most lightweight and reduces boilerplate)
- [ ] form validation with react-hook-form and zod
- [ ] protected routes, let's try to keep it simple before using something like next-auth or better-auth

note: was going to build the components from scratch, but since I'm going to run low on time, I'mm use shadcn for now..

changed my mind, going to handle auth with next form actions

## BDD

Just doing a rough translation of the requirements into user stories for BDD approach:

### Auth

- given a user visits the sign-in page
- when they enter the (spoofed) credentials
- then they should be redirected to the photos page
- and their auth state should persist (localStosage for now)
- and they should see the photos list

- given the user it not authenticated
- when they try to access the photos page directly
- then they should be redirected to the sign-in page
- and see the sign-in form

...and loading state (not required, but good practice)
...and 10 nature photos
...and responsive/mobile friendly
...and error handling (eg. if API fails, show a message)

## Architecture

### Code Quality

### Testing

### Design patterns

### State Management
